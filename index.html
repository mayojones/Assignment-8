    <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>

    <div id="content">
        <p id="fun-font" style="text-align:center;">
                My idea for this project is to create a website with: 
        </p> 
        <h2 style="text-align:center;"> Plant Care Information. </h2>
        <p>

                I have probably made it clear by now but I really love plants. And I love to talk about plants with my friends, which normally evolves into be becoming a plant doctor for their plants.  So I thought this would be a fun way to share my knowledge and interest. 
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>  
                <p id="fun-font" style="text-align:center;"><strong>Plant Doctor</strong><i>(tentative name)</i></p>
        
         <div class="group">
                <div class="column-left">
                    <img src="home.png" width="400px">
                </div>
            <div class="column-text-R">
                <p> 
                    I was thinking more of a straight forward website. Like in the nav bar there would be a tab for plant identification,  a tab for specifically problems with plants, and also a search bar. I am also thinking of maybe a tab for “adding a plant to your collection,” but I think that would depend on if I can actually do that with my knowledge and time constraints.  The home page would probably be simple with maybe a shout out to a plant of the week, and other stuff. Or maybe the website opens to the plant identification section.

        </div>

        <div class="group">
            <div class="column-text">
                <p>
                    Through the Identification tab people will be able to scroll through various plants that both include an image of the plant and its name to help with identification. I also think I might organize the plants into categories like philidendron to further help with identification. Once you click on a plant it will of course give you care instructions and information about the plant and show actual photos to help make sure that is the correct plant. To add some interest and personality I will do illustrations of the plants instead of just using images.

            </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="plant.png" width="400px">
                </div>
        </div>

        <div class="group">
            <div class="column-left">
                <img src="plant-1.png" width="350px">
            </div>
            <div class="column-text-R">
                <p>
                        Here is an example of a past plant illustration I have done, I will do the illustrations digitally but they will probably be in the same style.

        <div class="group">
            <div class="column-text">
                <p style="padding-top: 15%;">
                    In the problems/pests tab it will probably be things like yellowing or browning leaves, spider webs, and other problems that often afflict plants and how to solve them.

            <div class="column">

                    Overall I want the website to be inviting to both plant lovers and people new to plants. So you would be hopefully be able to find information and advice easily.  I love plants and I want mor people to get to enjoy loving plants without the fear of killing the plant.

                    As of now the only framework I am planning on using is bootstraps: https://getbootstrap.com
                </p>
                <diV class="list">
                    <p>
                        Some references for this site would be: 
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> The Sill, https://www.thesill.com/ - for content and design </li>
                        <li> Our House Plants, https://www.ourhouseplants.com/plants-hub - for content, they have similar concept on their plant page that I am going for</li>
                        <li> to be continued...</li>
                    </ul>
                </diV>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 15%;">Ok, that is my proposal for my final project. The idea might grow if I end up creating this faster than I think I will be able to. But currently I think i will be able to create this idea by the due date :) Thanks</p>
